# ============= Introduction To Linked List Data Strucutre=================

'''

Linked list is a linear data structrue , Made up of chain of Nodes in which each Node
contains Data field and link or refernce.
It means linked list is nothing but chain of Nodes 

'''

'''
Terms Of Linked List :

Node: elements of linked list
First Node is --> head
last Node is --> tail/end

'''

# Linked list is dynamic Data structure.

# Node of Linked list can be store randomly in memory(RAM) each Node contain refernce of next Node.

# In Linked List Inserstion And Deletion is easy.

# Using Linked List We Implement stack queue and graph.

# It needs Extra memory .

# Random access not possible , we have to access each Node. because we do not have address of next node.


'''
Types of Linked List:

1- Singly Linked List # contain one link
2- Doubly Linked List # contains 2 link
3- Circular Linked List #
