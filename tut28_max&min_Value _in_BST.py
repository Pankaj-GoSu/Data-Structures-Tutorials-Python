#====== Minimum and Maximum Value in Binary Search Tree ==========

# ==== Find Smallest Node ====
'''
smaller value occure in left sub tree 

'''

# ==== Find Greatest Value ==========
'''
right most node has largest value of BST.

'''

# ==== Total number of Node in Binary search tree ====

# --> no. of nodes Left sub tree + no. of Node in right sub tree + 1(root node)
    #--> repeat above process till then you reach to starting root node.
