# ======= Here We Talk about remaing Binary Tree types ===========

#========== Prefect Binary Tree ==============

'''
Type of binary tree in which all internal nodes contain 2 children and 
all leaf nodes are present at same level 

'''

#========= Balanced Binary Tree ==============

'''
Balanced Binary Tree is a tree in which height of left and the right sub tree atmost differ by 1.

Difference is absolute here.
we have to find this differnce for every node of binary tree.

# We take height of empty tree is -1  .

'''

# ========= Pathological Binary Tree / Degenrated Binary Tree ==========

"""
Degenrated binary tree is a binary tree where every parent node have only one child node.

# That means every internal node contain only one child.
