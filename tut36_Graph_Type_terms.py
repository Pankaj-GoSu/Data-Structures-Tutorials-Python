#============= Type Of Graphs =========

'''
Based on direction of the edges  we have two type in Graph:

1- Directed Graph : A graph in which all the edges are uni-directional

2- Undirected Graph: A graph in which all the edges are bi-directional

Based on weight we have two type of Graph:

1-Weighted Graph : A graph in which each edge is assigned with some weight/cost/value.

2-Unweighted Graph: A graph where there is no value or weight associated with the edge.

Based on graph contain cycle or not we have two type of graph:

1-Cyclic Graph : if contain cycle then cyclic graph
   
2-Acyclic Graph : if not contain cycle then Acyclic Graph.
     # Tree is a acyclic graph.
