#=========== Introduction To Graphs Data Strucutre ===============

'''
-->Graph is a non linear data structure consisiting of nodes and edges.
-->Nodes are also called as vertices.
--> Tree is a special type of graph that means tree will always be a graph but
    not all graph will be trees.

--> Tree are nothing more then the restricted type of graph.
--> In Tree we have a special node that is root node , and only one path between any 2 nodes.
--> In Graph we do not have any special node called root node here all nodes are equal.
    and between any 2 nodes we have multiple path.
    Graph can contain cycles , if we start from one node that after traversing few node we reach
    to same node.

--> Graphs are used in Google map and Gps : To find shortest fast from one place to another.
--> And to show some recomendation , and google search algorithem also use graph.

--> In computer science graph are used to show the flow of computations.
