#===== Introduction to Binary Heap Data Structure ==========

# Heap is a specilized tree based data structure 

# Heap Data Structure :
# - Binary heap
# - Binomial heap
# - Fibonaci heap

'''
# Binary Heap:

it is a complete binary tree which satisfies the heap property.

Heap Property:
Property of a node in which key of every parent node need to be lesser then or equal to Or greater than or equal to child node's key


# min heap / min binary heap:
        Complete binary tree , where the key of every parent node
        is less than or equal to child node's key

# max heap / max binary heap:
        Complete binary tree, where the key of every parent node 
        is greater thean or equal to child node's key

# we can use Binary heap data structure To impliment priority queue.
# we can use it in heap sort algorithem.
# and To find kth largest or smallest element in list of numbers.
