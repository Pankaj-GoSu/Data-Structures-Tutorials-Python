#=========== Binary Search Tree(BST) ===========

'''
Binary search tree is also called as ordered or sorted binary tree. it means binary search tree
is a binary tree.

'''

#Binary Search tree is a binary tree with following propeties:

# key's means value or node data

#1- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than node's key.

#2- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than node's key.
 
#3- The left subtree and right subtree each must also a BST.

# THis above defination is for if all values are distinct ==========

#============= Binary Search Tree With Duplicate values ==============

'''
1- In Some Books: Duplicate values not allowed in BST.
2- In some Books: If Duplicate values are present than put these values on left side of node.
3- In Some Books: If Duplicate values are present then put these values on right side of node.


duplicate values are present at any level.

And for duplicate value we make a counter which count how many time duplicate value occure.
